# Learning CPP

I've always wanted to learn cpp, but I always haven't the opportunity to. Whilst USACO, I found out that py was too slow, hence it gave me the reason to finally learn c++ formally.
This repo will be updated to contain all my exercises. Notes see [my blog](http://makabaka1880.xyz/CS/cpp).
